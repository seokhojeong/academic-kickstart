# About me

I am an Assistant Professor in Civil Engineering at Changwon National University, South Korea, with expertise in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and Geophysics.

I obtained BE in Civil Engineering from Changwon National University, Master in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology (MEEES) from Grenoble Alps University/University of Pavia/University of Patras as part of the Erasmus Mundus program in Europe, and PhD in Civil Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in the USA.

My research aims to advance the knowledge on the characteristics of earthquake ground shaking and develop new techniques to improve the Geotechnical and Earthquake Engineering practice.
