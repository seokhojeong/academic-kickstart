abstract = {Unusually severe structural damage was reported during the 2010 M 7.0 Haiti earthquake in the vicinity of Hotel Montana, located on top of a ridge in the district of P{\'{e}}tionville. Prompted by the observations, U.S. Geological Survey seismic stations were deployed, and aftershock recordings indicated ground‐motion amplification on the top of the hill compared to adjacent stations on reference site conditions. The presence of topographic relief has been shown to significantly aggravate the consequences of strong ground motion during past events, and topographic effects were brought forward to explain the observations. In this paper, we test the hypothesis of topographic amplification as the dominant factor that contributed to the damage concentration in the vicinity of Hotel Montana. We initially conduct numerical simulations of the ridge seismic response assuming elastic homogeneous site conditions, and show that numerical predictions of topographic amplification disagree with the field data both in amplitude and in frequency. Conversely, while 1D ground‐response analyses for the site conditions at the hilltop predict amplification in the same frequency range as the field data, they significantly underestimate the recorded amplitude. We then conduct numerical simulations of the foothill ridge response to seismic motion while accounting for soil layering, and qualitatively demonstrate that the recorded amplification is most likely attributed to coupled site–topographic amplification effects, namely to seismic waves trapped in the soft soil layers of the near surface, amplified as a consequence of reverberations, and further modified due to diffraction and scattering upon incidence on the irregular ground surface. Parametric investigations of the topography–soil amplification coupling effects are then conducted, and our results show that when accounting for a hypothetical soil–bedrock interface at 100 m depth, predictions are in excellent agreement with the observed motion.},

abstract = {Recent field investigations were carried out to define the shear wave velocity ( V S ) profile and site periods across the Canterbury region , supplementing earlier efforts in urban Christchurch . Active source surface wave t esting , ambient wave field (passive) and H/V spectral ratio methods were used to characterise the soil profile in the region. H/V spectral ratio peaks indicate site periods in the range of 5 -7 seconds across much of the Canterbury Plains, broadly consisten t with those based on a 1D velocity model for the region. Site periods decrease rapidly in the vicinity of the Canterbury foothills and the Banks Peninsula outcrops. In Christchurch, the Riccarton Gravels result in a significant mode of vibration that has a much shorter period than the site period of the entire soil column down to basement rock.},

abstract = {Abstract The strong motion station at Heathcote Valley School (HVSC) recorded intense ground accelerations (peak value of 1.4 g in horizontal and 2.2 g in vertical component) during the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. More importantly, ground motions recorded at {\{}HVSC{\}} in numerous other events during the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence also exhibited consistently larger peak ground accelerations compared with nearby strong motion stations, which suggests significant near-surface site amplification effects. This paper presents a quantitative case study of near-surface site effects of Heathcote Valley during the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence, by means of one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic finite element analyses based on the recorded ground motions and a rigorous site characterisation study. Various geophysical and geotechnical in-situ tests are performed to establish a simplified three-dimensional representation of wave velocities, mass densities and the geological structure (i.e. layering) of Heathcote Valley. Simulations are performed using the velocity profile at the location of station {\{}HVSC{\}} with the finite element analysis program OpenSees. Overall, simulations agree well with the recorded motions and suggest that ground motions at {\{}HVSC{\}} are amplified in a wide band of frequencies. However, the one-dimensional simulations tend to underestimate the site response at frequencies higher than the site fundamental frequency, likely due to its inability of modelling surface waves caused by the inclined soil-rock interface. Comparison between the nonlinear and the equivalent linear model shows that, although both approaches produce similar level of peak amplitude, the equivalent linear model significantly underestimates the high frequency motions.},
